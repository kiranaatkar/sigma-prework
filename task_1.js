/*
Write a short program that, when given a date, calculates the age between the current date and the given date. 

An example of an input and output might look like this: 

1990-01-01 should return 31

1972-12-04 should return 48 (this is the date format required to use Date.parse())


Hints: youâ€™ll likely need to use the JavaScript Date object. Some helpful links can be found here:
